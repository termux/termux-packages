The following checklist should be used for making a pacman release.

- Ensure "ninja dist" succeeds
- Call a freeze to development.
- Send translation updates to Transifex at least two weeks before a major
  release (see below).  At this stage, strings can only be changed for a
  major issue.
- Update NEWS and README files
- Pull translation updates from Transifex
- Update version in meson.build as described in file
- Update doc/index.asciidoc
- Create a signed git tag (git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "commit message")
- Create and sign release tarballs (generate with "ninja dist")
- Update pacman website

Transifex updates are handled using the transifex client. The basic process is:
- Pull updates from transifex ("tx pull -a -f --minimum-perc 75")
- Update po files ("./build-aux/update-po")
- Fix all translation errors found
- Add any new locales to the relevant LINGUAS file
- Optional: Make any manual changes needed (e.g. fixing spacing in a string)
  and update po files again
- Push updated po files to transifex ("tx push -s -t --skip")
