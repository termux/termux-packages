              - fix the download callback erroneously reporting itself too many
                times with --noprogressbar, or reporting inaccurate times for

              - Do not recognize # as a comment unless it is at the beginning of
                a line. This allows using it as a value in ini files (FS#48702)
              - ignore comments when examining INSTALL files (FS#51916)
              - match multi-byte user input properly (FS#47992)
              - abort transactions if even one database fails to sync (FS#47599)
              - do not resolve uid/gid to names when extracting files with -r
              - --dbonly now properly extracts metadata files (FS#52052)
              - remove support for internal checksumming implementations, and
                require at least one of openssl or nettle to exist
              - consider provides to satisfy optdepends when warning for removal

              - changed license field to operate as an array, not a string
              - added more logic for file conflict checks - if one target
                is a file and the other is a directory, then it's a conflict
              - fixed the integrity check in pacman-optimize
              - reverted NoUpgrade to old behaviour and instead, added the
                NoExtract directive to pacman.conf, which prevents a file
                from ever being extracted on to the system
                 eg, NoExtract = home/httpd/html/index.html
2.9.6         - added a pacman-optimize script to try and defragment the DB
              - modified NoUpgrade behaviour to avoid extracting files
                that are missing from the filesystem -- this helps in
                situations where the admin does not want the file there, eg,
                remove index.html so index.php takes precedence
              - fixed a bug where files would sometimes go missing if they
                moved from one package to another
              - add db_remove() which is responsible for clearing out stale
                hash table entries when packages are removed

                empty or whitespace-only strings
              - fixed removal order when using -Rc or -Rs
2.9.4         - fixed a bug that was introduced from another bugfix :-/
2.9.3         - fixed a couple manpage typos
              - added --ignore to -S operations, works just like IgnorePkg
              - respect IgnorePkg list when pulling in dependencies
              - numerous memleak fixes
              - some code changes to improve customizability/branding
              - Makefile fix for nonstandard lib search paths (Kevin Piche)
              - fixed the leftover directories in /tmp
              - speed improvement patches from Tommi Rantala
2.9.2         - bugfix for 2.9.1
2.9.1         - --refresh now only downloads fresh packages lists if they've
                been updated (currently only works with FTP)
2.9           - Improved -Rs functionality -- pacman now tracks why a package
                is installed: explicitly, or as a dependency for another
                package.  -Rs will only remove dependencies that were not
                explicitly installed.
              - Added compressed package size to sync DBs -- shows the total
                size of packages before downloading
              - Patch from Tommi Rantala:
                - Allow --info and --list together in queries
              - Patch from Kevin Piche:
                - Use list_add_sorted() with -Sg
              - Patch from Hegedus Marton Csaba:
                - Better manpage compression
              - Added checks for additional hyphens in package versions

2.8.4         - Added updatesync script from Jason Chu
              - Changed the pacman binary to be dynamically linked
                - Included a pacman.static binary as well
                - Added fakeroot checks when seeing if we're root
              - Fixed makepkg to use 'tail -n 1' instead of 'tail -1'
              - Added patch from Kevin Piche:
                - Cleanup db_loadpkgs(), add list_add_sorted()
              - Fixed a memory leak in db_find_conflicts()
2.8.3         - Fixed a little makepkg bug with bash 3.0
              - Fixed resolvedeps to always prefer literals over provisios
              - Added --config option to specify an alternate config file
              - Added "Include" directive to include repositories from
                config files (inspired by Michael Baehr's patch)
              - Added patch from Jason Chu:
                - Even smarter file-conflict checking
2.8.2         - Fixed a segfault bug in file-conflict checks
              - Made --noconfirm actually work.  Go me.
2.8.1         - Added a HoldPkg option in pacman.conf, for the more
                exploratory users who run things like "pacman -R pacman".  It
                will ask for confirmation before removing any packages listed
                in the HoldPkg list
              - Added a --noconfirm switch for use with script automation
              - Modified dependency resolution to prefer packages explicitly
                requested on the cmdline instead of those pulled in by
                resolvedeps().  Example, if neither "xorg" nor "xfree86" is
                installed and "blackbox xfree86" is requested, "xfree86" will
                be used instead of "xorg"
              - Added patch from Jason Chu:
                - Smarter file-conflict checking with symlinked paths and
                  with files that move from one package to another
2.8           - Bugfixes:
                - FS#861:  file:/// urls not handled properly with XferCommand
                - FS#1003: set umask before scriptlet calls
                - FS#1027: download problems with http urls using -U/-A
                - FS#1044: segfaults when using -Rs
                - FS#863:  "missing post_remove" errors with some packages
                - FS#875:  detect low disk space properly
                - FS#986:  makepkg -e doesn't validate files
                - FS#1010: add -j option to makepkg
                - FS#1028: make pacman -Sp runnable as non-root
              - added pre_install and pre_upgrade scriptlet support
              - added an "Architecture" field in the package meta-data

                adding or removing packages
              - added implementation of GNU's strverscmp function for better
                portability
              - added explicit unlink() calls when --force is used, which
                prevents those nasty "Text file busy" errors when you
                force-upgrade something like pacman or glibc.
2.7.9         - added the "force" option to packages, so --sysupgrade can
                downgrade packages when it needs to
2.7.8         - added post_remove scriptlet support
              - added -Qs option (FS#854)
              - a provisio does not imply conflict, to make a provisio target
                conflict with anything else that provides the same thing, you
                can now do this by specifying the provisio target as both a
                provides and a conflict, eg:
                   conflicts=('x-server')
                   provides=('x-server')
              - cleaned up the download progress bar a bit
              - added %o parameter to XferCommand so wget can resume properly
              - fixed a segfault in downloadfiles() (FS#787)
              - patches from Oliver Burnett-Hall
                - gensync uses a better temp dir (FS#774)
                - PKGDEST can be set in makepkg.conf (FS#783)
              - patches from Aurelien Foret

              - if pacman sees a newer version of itself during an upgrade,

              - Modified pacman's behaviour wrt provides -- it now allows
                multiple packages to be installed, even if they provide the
                same thing (they were treated as conflicts before)
2.6           - Added group handling, so one can run 'pacman -S kde' and

                can now either A) download/install missing deps with pacman
