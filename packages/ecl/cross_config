###
### YOU ARE TRYING TO CROSS COMPILE ECL.
### PLEASE FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:
###
### 1) Vital information cannot be determined at configuration time
### because we are not able to run test programs. A file called
###		
### has been created, that you will have to fill out. Please do
### it before invoking "configure" again.

### 1.1) Direction of growth of the stack
ECL_STACK_DIR=down

### 1.2) Choose an integer datatype which is large enough to host a pointer
CL_FIXNUM_TYPE="long int"
CL_FIXNUM_BITS=64
CL_FIXNUM_MAX="2305843009213693951L"
CL_FIXNUM_MIN="-2305843009213693952L"
CL_INT_BITS=32
CL_LONG_BITS=64

### 1.3) Order of bytes within a word
ECL_BIGENDIAN=no

### 1.4) What characters signal an end of line. May be LF (Linefeed or \n)
###      CR (Carriage return or \r), and CRLF (CR followed by LF).
ECL_NEWLINE=LF

### 1.5) Can we guess how many characters are available for reading from
###      the FILE structure?
###          0 = no
###          1 = (f)->_IO_read_end - (f)->_IO_read_ptr
###          2 = (f)->_r
###          3 = (f)->_cnt
ECL_FILE_CNT=2

###
### 1.6) Other integer types (set to 'no' to disable)
###
ECL_STDINT_HEADER="#include <stdint.h>"
ECL_UINT8_T=uint8_t
ECL_UINT16_T=uint16_t
ECL_UINT32_T=uint32_t
ECL_UINT64_T=uint64_t
ECL_INT8_T=int8_t
ECL_INT16_T=int16_t
ECL_INT32_T=int32_t
ECL_INT64_T=int64_t
ECL_LONG_LONG_BITS=64

###
### 1.7) Other features (set to 'no' to disable)
###
ECL_WORKING_ENVIRON=yes

### 2) To cross-compile ECL so that it runs on the system
###		aarch64-unknown-linux-android
### you need to first compile ECL on the system in which you are building
### the cross-compiled files, that is
###		x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
### By default we assume that ECL can be accessed from some directory in
### the path.
ECL_TO_RUN=/home/builder/.termux-build/_cache/ecl-16.1.3/bin/ecl
