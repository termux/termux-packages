async function download(url) {

## API

**constructor(stream: ReadableStream): Promise<void>**

`stream: ReadableStream`: the [Web-API readable stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamDefaultReader).

**close(): Promise<void>**
Will cancel close the Readable-node stream, and will release Web-API-readable-stream.

**waitForReadToComplete(): Promise<void>**
If there is no unresolved read call to Web-API Readableâ€‹Stream immediately returns, otherwise it will wait until the read is resolved.
