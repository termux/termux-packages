Subject: [PATCH] fix potential UAF in header handling (CVE-2023-49606)

https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2023-1889

this bug was brought to my attention today by the debian tinyproxy
package maintainer. the above link states that the issue was known
since last year and that maintainers have been contacted, but if
that is even true then it probably was done via a private email
to a potentially outdated email address of one of the maintainers,
not through the channels described clearly on the tinyproxy homepage:

> Feel free to report a new bug or suggest features via github issues.
> Tinyproxy developers hang out in #tinyproxy on irc.libera.chat.

no github issue was filed, and nobody mentioned a vulnerability on
the mentioned IRC chat. if the issue had been reported on github or
IRC, the bug would have been fixed within a day.
