.SH NAME
dict \- DICT Protocol Client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BI dict " word"
.br
.BI dict " [options] [word]"
.br
.BI dict " [options] dict://host:port/d:word:database"
.br
.BI dict " [options] dict://host:port/m:word:database:strategy"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dict
is a client for the Dictionary Server Protocol (DICT), a TCP transaction
based query/response protocol that provides access to dictionary
definitions from a set of natural language dictionary databases.
Exit status is 0 if operation succeeded, or non-zero otherwise.
.br
See
.B EXIT STATUS
section.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-h " server\fR or " \-\-host " server"
Specifies the hostname for the DICT server.  Server/port combinations can
be specified in the configuration file.  If no servers are specified
in the configuration file or or on the command line, 
.B dict 
will fail.  (This is a compile-time option, ./configure
--enable-dictorg, which is disabled by default.)  If IP lookup for a
server expands to a list of IP addresses (as dict.org does currently),
then each IP will be tried in the order listed.
.TP
.BI \-p " service\fR or " \-\-port " service"
Specifies the port (e.g., 2628) or service (e.g., dict) for connections.
The default is 2628, as specified in the DICT Protocol RFC.  Server/port
combinations can be specified in the configuration file.
.TP
.BI \-d " dbname\fR or " \-\-database " dbname"
Specifies a specific database to search.  The default is to search all
databases (a "*" from the DICT protocol).  Note that a "!" in the DICT
protocol means to search all of the databases until a match is found, and
then stop searching.
.TP
.BR \-m " or " \-\-match
Instead of printing a definition, perform a match using the specified
strategy.
.TP
.BI \-s " strategy\fR or " \-\-strategy " strategy"
Specify a matching strategy.  By default, the server default match strategy
is used.  This is usually "exact" for definitions, and some form of
spelling-correction strategy for matches ("." from the DICT protocol).
The available strategies are dependent on the server implementation.  For
a list of available strategies, see the \-S or \-\-strats option.
.TP
.BR \-C " or " \-\-nocorrect
Usually, if a definition is requested and the word cannot be found,
spelling correction is requested from the server, and a list of possible
words are provided.  This option disables the generation of this list.
.TP
.BI \-c " file\fR or " \-\-config " file"
Specify the configuration file.  The default is to try
.I ~/.dictrc
and
.IR @SYSCONFDIR@/dict.conf ,
using the first file that exists.  If a specific configuration file is
specified, then the defaults will not be tried.
.TP
.BR \-D " or " \-\-dbs
Query the server and display a list of available databases.
.TP
.BR \-S " or " \-\-strats
Query the server and display a list of available search strategies.
.TP
.BR \-H " or " \-\-serverhelp
Query the server and display the help information that it provides.
.TP
.BI \-i " dbname\fR or " \-\-info " dbname"
Request information on the specified database (usually the server will
provide origination, descriptive, or other information about the database
or its contents).
.TP
.BR \-I " or " \-\-serverinfo
Query the server and display information about the server.
.TP
.BR \-M " or " \-\-mime
Send
.I OPTION MIME
command to the server.
.RS
.B NOTE:
Server's capabilities are not checked.
.RE

.TP
.BR \-f " or " \-\-formatted
Enables formatted output, i.e. output convenient for postprocessing
by standard UNIX utilities. No, it is not XML ;\-)
Also error and warning messages like
 " No matches...", " Invalid strategy..." etc. are sent to stderr,
not to stdout.
.RS
.B Format:
 \-I, \-i, \-H and similar:
.br
    host<TAB>port
.br
    <SPC><SPC>line1
.br
    <SPC><SPC>line2
.br
    ...
 \-S:
.br
    host<TAB>port<TAB>strategy1<TAB>short description1
.br
    host<TAB>port<TAB>strategy2<TAB>short description2
.br
    ...
 \-D:
.br
    host<TAB>port<TAB>database1<TAB>database description1
.br
    host<TAB>port<TAB>database2<TAB>database description2
.br
    ...
.br
 \-m:
.br
    host<TAB>port<TAB>database1<TAB>match1
.br
    host<TAB>port<TAB>database2<TAB>match2
.br
    ...

.RE
.TP
.BR \-a " or " \-\-noauth
Disable authentication (i.e., don't send an AUTH command).
.TP
.BI \-u " user\fR or " \-\-user " user"
Specifies the username for authentication.
.TP
.BI \-k " key\fR or " \-\-key " key"
Specifies the shared secret for authentication.
.TP
.BR \-V " or " \-\-version
Display version information.
.TP
.BR \-L " or " \-\-license
Display copyright and license information.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Display help information.
.TP
.BR -v " or " \-\-verbose
Be verbose.
.TP
.BR -r " or " \-\-raw
Be very verbose: show the raw client/server interaction.
.TP
.B \-\-pipesize
Specify the buffer size for pipelineing commands.  The default is 256,
which should be sufficient for general tasks and be below the MTU for most
transport media.  Larger values may provide faster or slower throughput,
depending on MTU.  If the buffer is too small, requests will be
serialized.  Values less than 0 and greater than one million are silently
changed to something more reasonable.
.TP
.BI \-\-client " text"
Specifies additional text to be sent using the CLIENT command.
.TP
.BI \-\-debug " flag"
Set a debugging flag.  Valid flags are:
.RS
.TP
.B verbose
The same as
.BR \-v " or " \-\-verbose .
.TP
.B raw
The same as
.BR \-r " or " \-\-raw .
.TP
.B scan
Debug the scanner for the configuration file.
.TP
.B parse
Debug the parser for the configuration file.
.TP
.B pipe
Debug TCP pipelining support (see the DICT RFC and RFC1854).
.TP
.B serial
Disable pipelining support.
.TP
.B time
Perform transaction timing.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The configuration file currently has a very simple format.  Lines are used
to specify servers, for example:
.RS
server dict.org
.RE
or, with options:
.RS
server dict.org { port 8080 }
.br
server dict.org { user username secret }
.br
server dict.org { port dict user username secret }
.RE
the
.B port
and
.B user
options may be specified in any order.  The
.B port
option is used to specify an optional port (e.g., 2628) or service (e.g.,
dict) for the TCP/IP connection.  The
.B user
option is used to specify a username and shared secret to be used for
authentication to this particular server.
.P
Servers are tried in the order listed until a connection is made.  If none
of the specified servers are available, and the compile-time option
(./configure --enable-dictorg) is enabled, then an attempt will be made to
connect on
.B localhost
and on
.B dict.org
at the standard part (2628).  (This option is disabled by default.)
We expect that dict.org will point to one or more DICT servers
(perhaps in round-robin fashion) for the foreseeable future (starting
in July 1997), although it is difficult to predict anything on the
Internet for more than about 3-6 months.

.SH BUGS
If a
.B dict:
URL is given on the command line, only the first one is used.  The rest are
ignored.
.P
If a
.B dict:
URL contains a specifier for the nth definition or match of a word, it will
be ignored and all the definitions or matches will be provided.  This
violates the RFC, and will be corrected in a future release.
.P
If a
.B dict:
URL contains a shared secret, it will not be parsed correctly.
.P
When
.I OPTION MIME
command is sent to the server
.I (-M option)
, server's capabilities are not checked.
