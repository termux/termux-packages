.TH DICTZIP 1 "22 Jun 1997" "" ""
.SH "NAME"
dictzip, dictunzip \- compress (or expand) files, allowing random access
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.nf
.BI "dictzip [" options "] " name
.br
.BI "dictunzip [" options "] " name
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B dictzip
compresses files using the
.BR gzip (1)
algorithm (LZ77) in a manner which is completely compatible with the
.BR gzip
file format.  An extension to the
.B gzip
file format (Extra Field, described in 2.3.1.1 of RFC 1952) allows extra
data to be stored in the header of a compressed file.  Programs like
.B gzip
and
.B zcat
will ignore this extra data.  However,
.BR dictd (8),
the DICT protocol dictionary server will make use of this data to perform
pseudo-random access on the file.  Files in the
.B dictzip
format should end in ".dz" so that they may be distinguished from common
.B gzip
files that do not contain the special header information.
.P
From RFC 1952, the extra field is specified as follows:
.sp
.RS
If the FLG.FEXTRA bit is set, an "extra field" is present in
the header, with total length XLEN bytes.  It consists of a
series of subfields, each of the form:
.sp
.nf
+---+---+---+---+==================================+
|SI1|SI2|  LEN  |... LEN bytes of subfield data ...|
+---+---+---+---+==================================+
.fi
.sp
SI1 and SI2 provide a subfield ID, typically two ASCII letters
with some mnemonic value.  Jean-Loup Gailly
<gzip@prep.ai.mit.edu> is maintaining a registry of subfield
IDs; please send him any subfield ID you wish to use.  Subfield
IDs with SI2 = 0 are reserved for future use.
.P
LEN gives the length of the subfield data, excluding the 4
initial bytes.
.RE
.sp
The
.B dictzip
program uses 'R' for SI1, and 'A' for SI2 (i.e., "Random Access").  After
the LEN field, the data is arranged as follows:
.sp
.nf
+---+---+---+---+---+---+===============================+
|  VER  | CHLEN | CHCNT |  ... CHCNT words of data ...  |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+===============================+
.fi
.sp
As per RFC 1952, all data is stored least-significant byte first.  For VER
1 of the data, all values are 16-bits long (2 bytes), and are unsigned
integers.
.P
XLEN (which is specified earlier in the header) is a two byte integer, so
the extra field can be 0xffff bytes long, 2 bytes of which are used for the
subfield ID (SI1 and SI1), and 2 bytes of which are used for the subfield
length (LEN).  This leaves 0xfffb bytes (0x7ffd 2-byte entries or 0x3ffe
4-byte entries).  Given that the zip output buffer must be 10% + 12 bytes
larger than the input buffer, we can store 58969 bytes per entry, or about
1.8GB if the 2-byte entries are used.  If this becomes a limiting factor,
another format version can be selected and defined for 4-byte entries.
.P
For compression, the file is divided up into "chunks" of data, each chunk
is less than 64kB, and can be compressed into an area that is also less
than 64kB long (taking incompressible data into account -- usually the data
is compressed into a block that is much smaller than the original).  The
CHLEN field specifies the length of a "chunk" of data.  The CHCNT field
specifies how many chunks are preset, and the CHCNT words of data specifies
how long each chunk is after compression (i.e., in the current compressed
file).
.P
To perform random access on the data, the offset and length of the data are
provided to library routines.  These routines determine the chunk in which
the desired data begins, and decompresses that chunk.  Consecutive chunks
are decompressed as necessary.
.SH "TRADEOFFS"
.TP
.B Speed
True random file access is not realized, since any access, even for a
single byte, requires that a 64kB chunk be read and decompressed.  This is
slower than accessing a flat text file, but is much, much faster than
performing serial access on a fully compressed file.
.TP
.B Space
For the textual dictionary databases we are working with, the use of 64kB
chunks and maximal LZ77 compression realizes a file which is only about 4%
larger than the same file compressed all at once.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BR \-d " or " \-\-decompress
Decompress.  This is the default if the executable is called
.BR dictunzip .
.TP
.BR \-c " or " \-\-stdout
Write output on standard output; keep original files unchanged.  This is
only available when decompressing (because parts of the header must be
updated after a write when compressing).
.TP
.BR \-f " or " \-\-force
Force compression or decompression even if the output file already exists.
.TP
.BR \-h " or " \-\-help
Display help.
.TP
.BR \-k " or " \-\-keep
Do not delete the original file.
.TP
.BR \-l " or " \-\-list
For each compressed file, list the following fields:

    type: dzip, gzip, or text (includes files in unknown formats)
    crc: CRC checksum
    date and time: from header
    chunks: number of chunks in file
    size: size of each uncompressed chunk
    compr.: compressed size
    uncompr.: uncompressed size
    ratio: compression ratio (0.0% if unknown)
    name: name of uncompressed file

Unlike
.BR gzip ,
the compression method is not detected.
.TP
.BR \-L " or " \-\-license
Display the
.B dictzip
license and quit.
.TP
.BR \-t " or " \-\-test
Check the compressed file integrity.  This option is not implemented.
Instead, it will list the header information.
.TP
.BR \-v " or " \-\-verbose
Verbose. Display extra information during compression.
.TP
.BR \-V " or " \-\-version
Version. Display the version number and compilation options then quit.
.TP
.BI \-s " start\fR or " \-\-start " start"
Specify the offer to start decompression, using decimal numbers.  The
default is at the beginning of the file.
.TP
.BI \-e " size\fR or " \-\-size " size"
Specify the size of the portion of the file to decompress, using decimal
numbers.  The default is the whole file.
.TP
.BI \-S " start\fR or " \-\-Start " start"
Specify the offer to start decompression, using base64 numbers.  The
default is at the beginning of the file.
.TP
.BI \-E " size\fR or " \-\-Size " start"
Specify the size of the portion of the file to decompress, using base64
numbers.  The default is the whole file.
.TP
.BI \-p " prefilter\fR or " \-\-pre " prefilter"
Specify a shell command to execute as a filter before compression or
decompression of a chunk.  The pre- and post-compression filters can be
used to provide additional compression or output formatting.  The filters
may not increase the buffer size significantly.  The pre- and
post-compression filters were designed to provide the most general
interface possible.
.TP
.BI \-P " postfilter\fR or " \-\-post " postfilter"
Specify a shell command to execute as a filter after compression or
decompression.
