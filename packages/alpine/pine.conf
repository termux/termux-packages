# Alpine configuration file
#
# This file sets the configuration options used by Alpine and PC-Alpine. These
# options are usually set from within Alpine or PC-Alpine. There may be a
# system-wide configuration file which sets the defaults for some of the
# variables. On Unix, run alpine -conf to see how system defaults have been set.
# For variables that accept multiple values, list elements are separated by
# commas. A line beginning with a space or tab is considered to be a
# continuation of the previous line. For a variable to be unset its value must
# be blank. To set a variable to the empty string its value should be "".
# You can override system defaults by setting a variable to the empty string.
# Lines beginning with "#" are comments, and ignored by Alpine.
