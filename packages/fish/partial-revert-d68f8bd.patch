Partially reverts https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/commit/d68f8bdd3b60a4a4cee0c938b5b3e2ff23c1ed86

In order to work around "error: call to undeclared function 'UNUSED'"

This topic is closely related to this other commit,
https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/commit/70bd49f61265c3a50c98d439fc77e13ef4409231
which is not yet present in stable fish (4.0.6 at time of writing),
but which will probably also break the build of fish for Android in the future and need to be
reverted or partially reverted.
