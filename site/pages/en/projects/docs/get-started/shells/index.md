# Shells

<!-- @ARK_DOCS__HEADER_PLACEHOLDER@ -->

Termux provides the following shells. The [`bash`](#bash) shell is the default shell in Termux.

If you've never used a Linux shell or terminal (also called command-line interface) before, it can be intimidating. We think 
[this interactive tutorial](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell) that runs in your browser is a good way to learn the basics. Also check the `See also` section for [`bash`](#bash) for more guides.

### bash

The `bash` is the default shell in Termux and in many linux distos and so is considered a portable shell. Learning it or related posix compatible shells will be very useful if you want to be good at using Termux and a terminal and at running commands properly.
