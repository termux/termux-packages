        This is a bug tracker of the official Termux packages. Please do not report issues of third-party software there, but ask in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/discussions) or [Community Social Media](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Community) instead. Use search to check whether your issue has been already reported and perhaps solved.

        Android versions 5.x and 6.x are not supported anymore. Issues happening on these operating system versions will not be resolved.

        Before submitting any repository service issues, check https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/6726.

        To submit a bug report, fill the form below. Provide as much as possible information about the encountered issue. We may request extended information such as `strace` logs if considered necessary. This will help package maintainers to understand the problem correctly and provide a solution. Make sure that your logs do not leak sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc). Be patient, do not expect that issue could get resolved immediately.
