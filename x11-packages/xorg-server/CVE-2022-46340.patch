Subject: [PATCH 1/7] Xtest: disallow GenericEvents in XTestSwapFakeInput

XTestSwapFakeInput assumes all events in this request are
sizeof(xEvent) and iterates through these in 32-byte increments.
However, a GenericEvent may be of arbitrary length longer than 32 bytes,
so any GenericEvent in this list would result in subsequent events to be
misparsed.

Additional, the swapped event is written into a stack-allocated struct
xEvent (size 32 bytes). For any GenericEvent longer than 32 bytes,
swapping the event may thus smash the stack like an avocado on toast.

Catch this case early and return BadValue for any GenericEvent.
Which is what would happen in unswapped setups anyway since XTest
doesn't support GenericEvent.

CVE-2022-46340, ZDI-CAN 19265

This vulnerability was discovered by:
Jan-Niklas Sohn working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative
