This is https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15704
(Luanti's current choice to use Irrlicht only without SDL2, until a future release)
In Termux this is necessary to enable EGL support for improved driver compatibility
and performance, but if Luanti migrates to SDL2 in the future, at that time, it might
be possible to enable EGL support in SDL2 for Luanti on Termux also.
