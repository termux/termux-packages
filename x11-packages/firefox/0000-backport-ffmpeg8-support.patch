+                       Version 2.1, February 1999
+
+ Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
+ as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
+ the version number 2.1.]
+
+                            Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
+free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
+
+  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
+specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
+Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
+can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
+this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
+strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
+not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
+you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
+for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
+it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
+it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
+these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
+rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
+you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
+code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
+complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
+with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
+it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
+library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
+permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
+
+  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
+there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
+modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
+that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
+author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
+introduced by others.
+
+  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
+any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
+effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
+restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
+any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
+consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
+
+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
+ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
+General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
+is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
+this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
+libraries into non-free programs.
+
+  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
+a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
+combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
+General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
+entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
+Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
+the library.
+
+  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
+does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
+Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
+of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
+are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
+libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
+special circumstances.
+
+  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
+encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
+a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
+allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
+library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
+case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
+software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
+
+  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
+programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
+free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
+non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
+operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
+system.
+
+  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
+users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
+linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
+that program using a modified version of the Library.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
+"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
+former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
+be combined with the library in order to run.
+
+                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
+program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
+other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
+this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
+Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
+prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
+(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
+
+  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
+which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
+Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
+copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
+portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
+straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
+included without limitation in the term "modification".)
+
+  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
+all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
+and installation of the library.
+
+  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
+such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
+on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
+writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
+and what the program that uses the Library does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
+complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
+you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
+appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
+all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
+warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
+Library.
+
+  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
+and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
+fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
+
+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
+    in the event an application does not supply such function or
+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
+    its purpose remains meaningful.
+
+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
+    root function must still compute square roots.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
+it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Library.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
+these notices.
+
+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
+
+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
+the Library into a program that is not a library.
+
+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
+medium customarily used for software interchange.
+
+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
+linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
+
+  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
+contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
+library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
+
+  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
+
+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
+Library will still fall under Section 6.)
+
+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
+
+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
+link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
+engineering for debugging such modifications.
+
+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
+of these things:
+
+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
+    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
+    to use the modified definitions.)
+
+    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
+    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
+    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
+    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
+    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
+    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
+    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
+
+    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
+    least three years, to give the same user the materials
+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
+    than the cost of performing this distribution.
+
+    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
+    specified materials from the same place.
+
+    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
+
+  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
+Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
+the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
+normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
+the executable.
+
+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
+distribute.
+
+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
+
+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
+    Sections above.
+
+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
+
+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Library or works based on it.
+
+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
+this License.
+
+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
+written in the body of this License.
+
+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
+versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
+"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
+the Free Software Foundation.
+
+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
+and reuse of software generally.
+
+                            NO WARRANTY
+
+  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
+WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
+KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
+LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
+THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
+AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
+FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
+LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
+RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
+FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
+SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
+DAMAGES.
+
+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
+
+  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
+everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
+redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
+ordinary General Public License).
+
+  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
+safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
+"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
+    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
+    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
+    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
+    Lesser General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
+    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
+    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
+  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
+
+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990

+/**
+ * @ingroup libavc
+ * @defgroup lavc_encdec send/receive encoding and decoding API overview
+ * @{
+ *
+ * The avcodec_send_packet()/avcodec_receive_frame()/avcodec_send_frame()/
+ * avcodec_receive_packet() functions provide an encode/decode API, which
+ * decouples input and output.
+ *
+ * The API is very similar for encoding/decoding and audio/video, and works as
+ * follows:
+ * - Set up and open the AVCodecContext as usual.
+ * - Send valid input:
+ *   - For decoding, call avcodec_send_packet() to give the decoder raw
+ *     compressed data in an AVPacket.
+ *   - For encoding, call avcodec_send_frame() to give the encoder an AVFrame
+ *     containing uncompressed audio or video.
+ *
+ *   In both cases, it is recommended that AVPackets and AVFrames are
+ *   refcounted, or libavcodec might have to copy the input data. (libavformat
+ *   always returns refcounted AVPackets, and av_frame_get_buffer() allocates
+ *   refcounted AVFrames.)
+ * - Receive output in a loop. Periodically call one of the avcodec_receive_*()
+ *   functions and process their output:
+ *   - For decoding, call avcodec_receive_frame(). On success, it will return
+ *     an AVFrame containing uncompressed audio or video data.
+ *   - For encoding, call avcodec_receive_packet(). On success, it will return
+ *     an AVPacket with a compressed frame.
+ *
+ *   Repeat this call until it returns AVERROR(EAGAIN) or an error. The
+ *   AVERROR(EAGAIN) return value means that new input data is required to
+ *   return new output. In this case, continue with sending input. For each
+ *   input frame/packet, the codec will typically return 1 output frame/packet,
+ *   but it can also be 0 or more than 1.
+ *
+ * At the beginning of decoding or encoding, the codec might accept multiple
+ * input frames/packets without returning a frame, until its internal buffers
+ * are filled. This situation is handled transparently if you follow the steps
+ * outlined above.
+ *
+ * In theory, sending input can result in EAGAIN - this should happen only if
+ * not all output was received. You can use this to structure alternative decode
+ * or encode loops other than the one suggested above. For example, you could
+ * try sending new input on each iteration, and try to receive output if that
+ * returns EAGAIN.
+ *
+ * End of stream situations. These require "flushing" (aka draining) the codec,
+ * as the codec might buffer multiple frames or packets internally for
+ * performance or out of necessity (consider B-frames).
+ * This is handled as follows:
+ * - Instead of valid input, send NULL to the avcodec_send_packet() (decoding)
+ *   or avcodec_send_frame() (encoding) functions. This will enter draining
+ *   mode.
+ * - Call avcodec_receive_frame() (decoding) or avcodec_receive_packet()
+ *   (encoding) in a loop until AVERROR_EOF is returned. The functions will
+ *   not return AVERROR(EAGAIN), unless you forgot to enter draining mode.
+ * - Before decoding can be resumed again, the codec has to be reset with
+ *   avcodec_flush_buffers().
+ *
+ * Using the API as outlined above is highly recommended. But it is also
+ * possible to call functions outside of this rigid schema. For example, you can
+ * call avcodec_send_packet() repeatedly without calling
+ * avcodec_receive_frame(). In this case, avcodec_send_packet() will succeed
+ * until the codec's internal buffer has been filled up (which is typically of
+ * size 1 per output frame, after initial input), and then reject input with
+ * AVERROR(EAGAIN). Once it starts rejecting input, you have no choice but to
+ * read at least some output.
+ *
+ * Not all codecs will follow a rigid and predictable dataflow; the only
+ * guarantee is that an AVERROR(EAGAIN) return value on a send/receive call on
+ * one end implies that a receive/send call on the other end will succeed, or
+ * at least will not fail with AVERROR(EAGAIN). In general, no codec will
+ * permit unlimited buffering of input or output.
+ *
+ * A codec is not allowed to return AVERROR(EAGAIN) for both sending and
+ * receiving. This would be an invalid state, which could put the codec user
+ * into an endless loop. The API has no concept of time either: it cannot happen
+ * that trying to do avcodec_send_packet() results in AVERROR(EAGAIN), but a
+ * repeated call 1 second later accepts the packet (with no other receive/flush
+ * API calls involved). The API is a strict state machine, and the passage of
+ * time is not supposed to influence it. Some timing-dependent behavior might
+ * still be deemed acceptable in certain cases. But it must never result in both
+ * send/receive returning EAGAIN at the same time at any point. It must also
+ * absolutely be avoided that the current state is "unstable" and can
+ * "flip-flop" between the send/receive APIs allowing progress. For example,
+ * it's not allowed that the codec randomly decides that it actually wants to
+ * consume a packet now instead of returning a frame, after it just returned
+ * AVERROR(EAGAIN) on an avcodec_send_packet() call.

+   * - data[]
+   * - linesize[]
+   * - extended_data:

+   * - buf[] must contain one or more pointers to AVBufferRef structures. Each
+   * of the frame's data and extended_data pointers must be contained in these.
+   * That is, one AVBufferRef for each allocated chunk of memory, not
+   * necessarily one AVBufferRef per data[] entry. See: av_buffer_create(),
+   * av_buffer_alloc(), and av_buffer_ref().

+   *   buffers than buf[] can hold. extended_buf will be freed in

+ * Create and return a AVHWFramesContext with values adequate for hardware
+ * decoding. This is meant to get called from the get_format callback, and is
+ * a helper for preparing a AVHWFramesContext for AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx.
+ * This API is for decoding with certain hardware acceleration modes/APIs only.
+ *
+ * The returned AVHWFramesContext is not initialized. The caller must do this
+ * with av_hwframe_ctx_init().
+ *
+ * Calling this function is not a requirement, but makes it simpler to avoid
+ * codec or hardware API specific details when manually allocating frames.
+ *
+ * Alternatively to this, an API user can set AVCodecContext.hw_device_ctx,
+ * which sets up AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx fully automatically, and makes
+ * it unnecessary to call this function or having to care about
+ * AVHWFramesContext initialization at all.
+ *
+ * There are a number of requirements for calling this function:
+ *
+ * - It must be called from get_format with the same avctx parameter that was
+ *   passed to get_format. Calling it outside of get_format is not allowed, and
+ *   can trigger undefined behavior.
+ * - The function is not always supported (see description of return values).
+ *   Even if this function returns successfully, hwaccel initialization could
+ *   fail later. (The degree to which implementations check whether the stream
+ *   is actually supported varies. Some do this check only after the user's
+ *   get_format callback returns.)
+ * - The hw_pix_fmt must be one of the choices suggested by get_format. If the
+ *   user decides to use a AVHWFramesContext prepared with this API function,
+ *   the user must return the same hw_pix_fmt from get_format.
+ * - The device_ref passed to this function must support the given hw_pix_fmt.
+ * - After calling this API function, it is the user's responsibility to
+ *   initialize the AVHWFramesContext (returned by the out_frames_ref
+ * parameter), and to set AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx to it. If done, this must
+ * be done before returning from get_format (this is implied by the normal
+ *   AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx API rules).
+ * - The AVHWFramesContext parameters may change every time time get_format is
+ *   called. Also, AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx is reset before get_format. So
+ *   you are inherently required to go through this process again on every
+ *   get_format call.
+ * - It is perfectly possible to call this function without actually using
+ *   the resulting AVHWFramesContext. One use-case might be trying to reuse a
+ *   previously initialized AVHWFramesContext, and calling this API function
+ *   only to test whether the required frame parameters have changed.
+ * - Fields that use dynamically allocated values of any kind must not be set
+ *   by the user unless setting them is explicitly allowed by the documentation.
+ *   If the user sets AVHWFramesContext.free and AVHWFramesContext.user_opaque,
+ *   the new free callback must call the potentially set previous free callback.
+ *   This API call may set any dynamically allocated fields, including the free
+ *   callback.
+ *
+ * The function will set at least the following fields on AVHWFramesContext
+ * (potentially more, depending on hwaccel API):
+ *
+ * - All fields set by av_hwframe_ctx_alloc().
+ * - Set the format field to hw_pix_fmt.
+ * - Set the sw_format field to the most suited and most versatile format. (An
+ *   implication is that this will prefer generic formats over opaque formats
+ *   with arbitrary restrictions, if possible.)
+ * - Set the width/height fields to the coded frame size, rounded up to the
+ *   API-specific minimum alignment.
+ * - Only _if_ the hwaccel requires a pre-allocated pool: set the
+ * initial_pool_size field to the number of maximum reference surfaces possible
+ * with the codec, plus 1 surface for the user to work (meaning the user can
+ * safely reference at most 1 decoded surface at a time), plus additional
+ * buffering introduced by frame threading. If the hwaccel does not require
+ * pre-allocation, the field is left to 0, and the decoder will allocate new
+ * surfaces on demand during decoding.
+ * - Possibly AVHWFramesContext.hwctx fields, depending on the underlying
+ *   hardware API.
+ *
+ * Essentially, out_frames_ref returns the same as av_hwframe_ctx_alloc(), but
+ * with basic frame parameters set.
+ *
+ * The function is stateless, and does not change the AVCodecContext or the
+ * device_ref AVHWDeviceContext.
+ *
+ * @param avctx The context which is currently calling get_format, and which
+ *              implicitly contains all state needed for filling the returned
+ *              AVHWFramesContext properly.
+ * @param device_ref A reference to the AVHWDeviceContext describing the device
+ *                   which will be used by the hardware decoder.

+ * Bitstream filters transform encoded media data without decoding it. This
+ * allows e.g. manipulating various header values. Bitstream filters operate on
+ * @ref AVPacket "AVPackets".
+ *
+ * The bitstream filtering API is centered around two structures:
+ * AVBitStreamFilter and AVBSFContext. The former represents a bitstream filter
+ * in abstract, the latter a specific filtering process. Obtain an
+ * AVBitStreamFilter using av_bsf_get_by_name() or av_bsf_iterate(), then pass
+ * it to av_bsf_alloc() to create an AVBSFContext. Fill in the user-settable
+ * AVBSFContext fields, as described in its documentation, then call
+ * av_bsf_init() to prepare the filter context for use.
+ *
+ * Submit packets for filtering using av_bsf_send_packet(), obtain filtered
+ * results with av_bsf_receive_packet(). When no more input packets will be
+ * sent, submit a NULL AVPacket to signal the end of the stream to the filter.
+ * av_bsf_receive_packet() will then return trailing packets, if any are
+ * produced by the filter.
+ *
+ * Finally, free the filter context with av_bsf_free().
+ * @{

+ *
+ * This document describes the usage of the different libraries
+ * provided by FFmpeg.
+ *
+ * @li @ref libavc "libavcodec" encoding/decoding library
+ * @li @ref lavfi "libavfilter" graph-based frame editing library

+ * @li @ref libsws "libswscale" color conversion and scaling library
+ *
+ * @section ffmpeg_versioning Versioning and compatibility
+ *
+ * Each of the FFmpeg libraries contains a version.h header, which defines a
+ * major, minor and micro version number with the
+ * <em>LIBRARYNAME_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,MICRO}</em> macros. The major version
+ * number is incremented with backward incompatible changes - e.g. removing
+ * parts of the public API, reordering public struct members, etc. The minor
+ * version number is incremented for backward compatible API changes or major
+ * new features - e.g. adding a new public function or a new decoder. The micro
+ * version number is incremented for smaller changes that a calling program
+ * might still want to check for - e.g. changing behavior in a previously
+ * unspecified situation.
+ *
+ * FFmpeg guarantees backward API and ABI compatibility for each library as long
+ * as its major version number is unchanged. This means that no public symbols
+ * will be removed or renamed. Types and names of the public struct members and
+ * values of public macros and enums will remain the same (unless they were
+ * explicitly declared as not part of the public API). Documented behavior will
+ * not change.
+ *
+ * In other words, any correct program that works with a given FFmpeg snapshot
+ * should work just as well without any changes with any later snapshot with the
+ * same major versions. This applies to both rebuilding the program against new
+ * FFmpeg versions or to replacing the dynamic FFmpeg libraries that a program
+ * links against.

+ * AVBuffer is an API for reference-counted data buffers.
+ *
+ * There are two core objects in this API -- AVBuffer and AVBufferRef. AVBuffer
+ * represents the data buffer itself; it is opaque and not meant to be accessed
+ * by the caller directly, but only through AVBufferRef. However, the caller may
+ * e.g. compare two AVBuffer pointers to check whether two different references
+ * are describing the same data buffer. AVBufferRef represents a single
+ * reference to an AVBuffer and it is the object that may be manipulated by the
+ * caller directly.
+ *
+ * There are two functions provided for creating a new AVBuffer with a single
+ * reference -- av_buffer_alloc() to just allocate a new buffer, and
+ * av_buffer_create() to wrap an existing array in an AVBuffer. From an existing
+ * reference, additional references may be created with av_buffer_ref().
+ * Use av_buffer_unref() to free a reference (this will automatically free the
+ * data once all the references are freed).
+ *
+ * The convention throughout this API and the rest of FFmpeg is such that the
+ * buffer is considered writable if there exists only one reference to it (and
+ * it has not been marked as read-only). The av_buffer_is_writable() function is
+ * provided to check whether this is true and av_buffer_make_writable() will
+ * automatically create a new writable buffer when necessary.
+ * Of course nothing prevents the calling code from violating this convention,
+ * however that is safe only when all the existing references are under its
+ * control.
+ *
+ * @note Referencing and unreferencing the buffers is thread-safe and thus
+ * may be done from multiple threads simultaneously without any need for
+ * additional locking.
+ *
+ * @note Two different references to the same buffer can point to different
+ * parts of the buffer (i.e. their AVBufferRef.data will not be equal).

+ *
+ * The first system stores pointers to values in a block of dynamically
+ * allocated memory. Since only pointers are stored, the function does not need
+ * to know the size of the type. Both av_dynarray_add() and
+ * av_dynarray_add_nofree() implement this system.

+ * AV_PIX_FMT_RGB32 is handled in an endian-specific manner. An RGBA
+ * color is put together as:
+ *  (A << 24) | (R << 16) | (G << 8) | B
+ * This is stored as BGRA on little-endian CPU architectures and ARGB on
+ * big-endian CPUs.
+ *
+ * @note
+ * If the resolution is not a multiple of the chroma subsampling factor
+ * then the chroma plane resolution must be rounded up.
+ *
+ * @par
+ * When the pixel format is palettized RGB32 (AV_PIX_FMT_PAL8), the palettized
+ * image data is stored in AVFrame.data[0]. The palette is transported in
+ * AVFrame.data[1], is 1024 bytes long (256 4-byte entries) and is
+ * formatted the same as in AV_PIX_FMT_RGB32 described above (i.e., it is
+ * also endian-specific). Note also that the individual RGB32 palette
+ * components stored in AVFrame.data[1] should be in the range 0..255.
+ * This is important as many custom PAL8 video codecs that were designed
+ * to run on the IBM VGA graphics adapter use 6-bit palette components.
+ *
+ * @par
+ * For all the 8 bits per pixel formats, an RGB32 palette is in data[1] like
+ * for pal8. This palette is filled in automatically by the function
+ * allocating the picture.
