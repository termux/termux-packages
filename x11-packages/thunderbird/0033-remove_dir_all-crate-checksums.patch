This prevents this error:

error: checksum for `remove_dir_all v0.5.3` changed between lock files

this could be indicative of a few possible errors:

    * the lock file is corrupt
    * a replacement source in use (e.g., a mirror) returned a different checksum
    * the source itself may be corrupt in one way or another

unable to verify that `remove_dir_all v0.5.3` is the same as when the lockfile was generated
